# Student Database Management System 📚

Welcome to the Student Database Management System repository!🎓
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Student Database Management System implemented in C programming language. The project utilizes data structures and graphics in C to provide a user-friendly interface for managing student records. 🖥️

## Introduction 📝

The Student Database Management System is a console-based application that allows users to perform various operations related to student information. It provides an interactive menu-driven interface where users can add, delete, update, and search for student records. The system utilizes data structures like linked lists, arrays, and files for efficient data management. Additionally, it incorporates graphics in C programming to enhance the user experience.

## Features 🌟

- ➕ Add, delete, and update student records.
- 🔍 Search for students by various criteria such as name, roll number, or course.
- 📋 Display a list of all students.
- Calculate and display various statistics such as the average grade, highest grade, and lowest grade.
- 📂 Store and retrieve student data using data structures.
- 🎨 Utilize graphics to enhance the user interface.

## Requirements 🛠️

To run the Student Database Management System, the following requirements must be met:
- C compiler (GCC or any other C compiler that supports graphics libraries).
- Graphics libraries (such as graphics.h for Turbo C/C++ compiler or SDL library for Linux/Unix platforms).

## Installation and Usage 🚀

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations like adding, deleting, updating, or searching for student records.
